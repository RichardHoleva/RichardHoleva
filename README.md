# Hi, I'm Richard 👋

🇸🇰 From **Slovakia**, currently studying **Multimedia Design** in **Aarhus, Denmark** 🇩🇰  
I’m focused on **frontend development** — building accessible, responsive UIs with **JavaScript, React, HTML, and CSS**.

---

## 🚀 What I’m up to
- 🎓 Studying Multimedia Design in Aarhus (frontend-first curriculum)
- 🧠 Leveling up with **Scrimba** to deepen understanding *without AI* and really grasp the code
- 🛠️ Building small projects to practice patterns, state management, and clean components
- 🌱 Curious about **backend** (very early stage) — just exploring and mentioning it lightly 🙂

---

## 🧰 Tech Toolbox
- **Languages:** JavaScript (ES6+), HTML5, CSS3  
- **Framework & Build:** React, Vite  
- **Styling:** CSS Modules, basic Tailwind / utility-first approaches  
- **Tools:** Git & GitHub, VS Code, npm

> Always learning: better component architecture, hooks, accessibility, and performance.

---

## 📌 Recent / Small Projects
- ⚡ Mini React apps (state, effects, routing)
- 🎨 UI practice challenges (layouts, forms, animations)
- 🧩 Little utilities & experiments with Vite

*(More coming as I iterate!)*
