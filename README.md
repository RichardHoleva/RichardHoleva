# Hello World! I am Richard Holeva 👋

🇸🇰 Slovak in 🇩🇰 Aarhus — studying **Multimedia Design** (frontend-focused).  
I build with **React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS** and learn by shipping small projects.  
🧠 Leveling up via **Scrimba** (to really understand the code).  
🛜 Curious about **backend** (very early stage — just exploring Node/Express basics).

## 🧰 Stack
React · Vite · JS (ES6+) · HTML · CSS · Git/GitHub · VS Code

## 🌱 Currently Learning
- Better React patterns (hooks, state, accessibility)  
- Fetching & APIs  
- Backend fundamentals (routing, REST, simple DBs)
